\arguments{
\item{support}{a matrix for the support of all variables that enter
into the MTRs.}

\item{grid_index}{a vector, the row numbers of \code{support} used
to generate the grid preceding the audit.}

\item{uvec}{a vector, the points in the interval [0, 1] that the
unobservable takes on.}

\item{splines}{a list of lists. Each of the inner lists contains
details on the splines declared in the MTRs.}

\item{monov}{name of variable for which the monotonicity conditions
applies to.}

\item{uname}{name declared by user to represent the unobservable
term in the MTRs.}

\item{m0}{one-sided formula for marginal treatment response
function for the control group. The formula may differ from
what the user originally input in \code{\link{mst}}, as the
spline components should have been removed. This formula is
simply a linear combination of all covariates that enter into
the original \code{m0} declared by the user in
\code{\link{mst}}.}

\item{m1}{one-sided formula for marginal treatment response
function for the treated group. The formula may differ from
what the user originally input in \code{\link{mst}}, as the
spline components should have been removed. This formula is
simply a linear combination of all covariates that enter into
the original \code{m1} declared by the user in
\code{\link{mst}}.}

\item{sset}{a list containing the point estimates and gamma
components associated with each element in the S-set.}

\item{gstar0}{set of expectations for each terms of the MTR for the
control group.}

\item{gstar1}{set of expectations for each terms of the MTR for the
control group.}

\item{m0.lb}{scalar, lower bound on MTR for control group.}

\item{m0.ub}{scalar, upper bound on MTR for control group.}

\item{m1.lb}{scalar, lower bound on MTR for treated group.}

\item{m1.ub}{scalar, upper bound on MTR for treated group.}

\item{mte.lb}{scalar, lower bound on MTE.}

\item{mte.ub}{scalar, upper bound on MTE.}

\item{m0.dec}{boolean, indicating whether the MTR for the control
group is monotone decreasing.}

\item{m0.inc}{boolean, indicating whether the MTR for the control
group is monotone increasing.}

\item{m1.dec}{boolean, indicating whether the MTR for the treated
group is monotone decreasing.}

\item{m1.inc}{boolean, indicating whether the MTR for the treated
group is monotone increasing.}

\item{mte.dec}{boolean, indicating whether the MTE is monotone
decreasing.}

\item{mte.inc}{boolean, indicating whether the MTE is monotone
increasing.}

\value{
a list containing a unified constraint matrix, unified
    vector of inequalities, and unified RHS vector for the
    boundedness and monotonicity constraints of an LP problem.
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function generating the matrices and vectors
associated with the monotonicity and boundedness constraints
declared by the user.
