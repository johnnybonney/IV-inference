\title{Minimizing violation of observational equivalence}
\usage{
obseqmin.mst(sset, lpobj, lpsolver)
}
\arguments{
\item{sset}{A list of IV-like estimates and the corresponding gamma
terms.}

\item{lpobj}{A list of matrices and vectors defining an LP problem.}

\item{lpsolver}{string, name of the package used to solve the LP
problem.}
}
\value{
A list including the minimum violation of observational
    equivalence, the solution to the LP problem, and the status of
    the solution.
}
\description{
Given a set of IV-like estimates and the set of matrices/vectors
defining an LP problem, this function minimizes the violation of
observational equivalence under the L1 norm.
