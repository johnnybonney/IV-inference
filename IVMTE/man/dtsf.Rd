\description{
A simulated population-level data set characterizing the effect of
a treatment on an outcome. The data includes a treatment indicator,
a single covariate, and a single covariate. The unobservable terms
generating the outcomes are generated according to the following
specifications:
y1 ~ beta0 + beta1 * x + uSpline(degree = 2,
                                knots  = c(0.3, 0.6),
                                intercept = FALSE)
}
\details{
y0 = x : uSpline(degree = 0,
                 knots  = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8),
                 intercept = TRUE)
     + uSpline(degree = 1,
               knots  = c(0.4),
               intercept = TRUE)
     + beta3 * I(u ^ 2)
