regressions for the IV-like estimands.}

propensity to take up treatment. If a formula is declared, then
the function estimates propensity score according to the
formula and link specified. If a variable name is declared,
then the corresponding column in the data is taken as the

be chosen from \code{linear}, \code{probit}, or \code{logit}.}

\item{target.knots0}{user-defined set of functions defining the

equivalence. The threshold enters in multiplicatively. Thus, a
value of 0 corresponds to no violation of observational
equivalence, and the assumption that the model is correctly
specified.}

1] of the unobservable u used to form the grid for imposing
shape restrictions on the MTRs.}

MTRs.}

\item{lpsolver}{name of the linear programming package in R used to
obtain the bounds on the treatment effect.}

\item{point}{boolean, default set to \code{FALSE}. Set to
\code{TRUE} if it is believed that the treatment effects are
point identified. If set to \code{TRUE}, then a GMM procedure
is implemented to estimate the treatment effects. Shape
constraints on the MTRs will be ignored under point
identification.}

\item{point.tol}{scalar, set default at 1-e08. Tolerance for bounds
before automatically switchingto case of point
identification. So if the estimated bounds are narrower than
\code{point.tol}, and no shape restrictions are declared, the
function instead provides a point estimate of the treatment
effect. The output would be the same as if \code{point} was set
to \code{TRUE}.}

\value{
Returns a list of results from throughout the estimation
    procedure. This includes all IV-like estimands; the propensity
    score model; bounds on the treatment effect; the estimated
    expectations of each term in the MTRs; the components and
    results of the LP problem.
}
\description{
This function estimates bounds on treatment effect parameters,
following the procedure described in Mogstad, Torgovitsky
(2017). Of the target parameters, the user can choose from the ATE,
ATT, ATU, LATE, and generalized LATE. The user is required to
provide a polynomial expression for the marginal treatment
responses (MTR), as well as a set of regressions. By restricting
the set of coefficients on each term of the MTRs to be consistent
with the regression estimates, the function is able to restrict
itself to a set of MTRs. The bounds on the treatment effect
parameter correspond to finding coefficients on the MTRs that
maximize their average difference.
}
\details{
The estimation procedure relies on the propensity to take up
treatment. The propensity scores can either be estimated as part of
the estimation procedure, or the user can specify a variable in the
data set already containing the propensity scores.

Constraints on the shape of the MTRs and marginal treatment effects
(MTE) can be imposed by the user, also. Specifically, bounds and
monotonicity restrictions are permitted. These constraints are only
enforced over a subset of the data. However, an audit procedure
randomly selects points outside of this subset to determine whether
or not the constraints hold. The user can specify how stringent
this audit procedure is using the function arguments.
