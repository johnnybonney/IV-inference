\title{Generating the grid for the audit procedure}
\usage{
gengrid.mst(index, xsupport, usupport, uname)
}
\arguments{
\item{index}{a vector whose elements indicate the rows in the
matrix \code{xsupport} to include in the grid.}

\item{xsupport}{a matrix containing all the unique combinations of
the covariates included in the MTRs.}

\item{usupport}{a vector of evenly spaced points in the interval
[0, 1], including 0 and 1. The number of points is decided by
the user.}

\item{uname}{name declared by user to represent the unobservable
term.}
}
\value{
a list containing the grid used in the audit; a vector
    mapping the elements in the support of the covariates to
    \code{index}.
}
\description{
This function takes in a matrix summarizing the support of the
covariates, as well as an evenly spaced set of points summarizing
the support of the unobservable variable. A Cartesian product of
the subset of the support of the covariates and the points in the
support of the unobservable generates the grid that is used for the
audit procedure.
